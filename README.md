Food Calorie Estimator
Overview
The Food Calorie Estimator is a machine learning application that uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to classify food images and predict their calorie content. It provides a simple interface for users to upload food images and obtain predictions.

Features
Classifies food into predefined categories (e.g., Pizza, Waffles, Soup).
Estimates calorie content based on a predefined dataset.
Utilizes a CNN model for accurate predictions.
Includes a GUI using Tkinter for user-friendly interaction.
Supports image augmentation for training robust models.

Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: For image preprocessing.
Pandas: For managing the calorie dataset.
Tkinter: For creating a graphical user interface (GUI).
Matplotlib: For displaying the predicted food image and details.
